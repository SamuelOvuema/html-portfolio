<h1>The Best Movies According to Samuel</h1>
<h2>My best top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Boy and the Heron</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime at the moment, it has a mesmerizing fable that feels even more like a summary of an artistâ€™s career</p>
<h3>Poor Things</h3>
<p>Everything in this movie is wonderfully bizarre, from the performances and dialogue to the production and costume design.</p>
<h3>Silent Night</h3>
<p>The thoroughness in this movie is an exercise in pure filmmaking.</p>
